To set up the quarantine facilities at NIT Silchar, the institute has handed Hostel-1 and Hostel-2. The flight bound male passengers without accompaying children arriving at Silchar Airport will be quarantized for 14 days. Each of the quarantined building at NIT Silchar is multi-storied consisting of ground floor with 100 rooms, 1st floor with 100 rooms and 2nd floor with 50 rooms only. So, the total no. of rooms per quarantine centre is 250. 

For the ease of passengers, following rules are taken into consideration while assigning a room to passenger :

           I   . **Ground** floor will be alloted to senior citizen(above 60 years of age),
   
           II  . **1st** floor with be allotted to the persons in the age group of 40 yrs to 60 yrs , and 
  
           III . The **2nd** floor will be allotted to persons below 40 yrs.
           
 Hence, to keep the records of quarantized person, I have designed the quarantine facility management system. I have provided a piece of code(**mp1.sql**) suct that the records
  of the quarantined persons can be stored properly and accessed efficiently.
